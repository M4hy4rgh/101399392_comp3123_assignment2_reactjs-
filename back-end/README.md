Hello, Welcome to my repository for Assignment 1 of COMP3123. This repository contains a simple Node.js application that displays a message on the browser. I have used Postman to test the application and it works fine.

In order to run the application, you need to install the following dependencies:

- express
- nodemon

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

The application runs on port 3000. To view the application, open the browser and type the following URL:
